Shoutouts & thanks
---------
1) To Applidium (https://github.com/applidium/Cracking-Siri) for being the ground breakers for reversing Siri's protocol.
 
2) To Plamoni (https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy) for creating SiriProxy. Without his work, none of this would be possible.

3) To Senmu (https://github.com/senmu/SiriProxy-HockeyScores) for creating a plugin that got me interested in the project. Though I don't think any of his code is included in my work, it was my starting point with this project. I'll repay when I make my commits to the HockeyScores repo. 

4) To Cory Arcangel (cory@post-data.org) and Michael Frumin (mfrumin@eyebeam.org). Thanks for being the first to order a pizza from the command line, dudes.

5) To Travis Nickles ([Archived copy of http://www.ryochan7.com/blog/tag/pizza-py-party/](https://web.archive.org/web/20140521141459/http://www.ryochan7.com/blog/tag/pizza-py-party/)) the person who created Pizza-Py-Party. Though the latest public version of Pizza-Py-Party didn't work for me, I started with that and moved forward. Definitely a killer starting point.

Stuff that can be done
---------
1) General code cleanup. Much of the stuff I did I hacked in to provide a proof of concept. This is not an elegant solution, it just works. TONS of work can be done to improve the code of this plugin.

	-Trackdown and remove old relics from the original Pizza-Py-Party

		-Old HTMLLib stuff is horrid, some has been removed

		-Plenty of old commented out code, some from the original Pizza-Py-Party

2) Plugin features:

	-Support coupons in a real manner

	-Support sides (sodas, wings, cinnasticks, etc)

	-Go back and edit a pizza

	-Support multiple addresses (deliver to home or office)

	-Support delivery types (delivery or carryout)

	-All sorts of input validation

	-Siri interaction/behavior -- find and produce a more natural order script

	-Toppings

		-Allow for half pizza toppings (e.g. Pepperoni on left, Bacon on right)

		-Allow for "extra" or "light" topping amounts (e.g. Extra cheese, light olives)

		-Non default cheese and sauce options

	-BUG: Quantities don't work. If you order three identical pizzas, you'll only get one. Fix that too.
	
3) Really ballsy? Make it support other companies (Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, whatever)
